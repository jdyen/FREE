### Tasks to complete:
- update methods (plot, print, summary) for Gibbs sampler models
- test variance terms for exchangeable priors in functional response models
- add model families for the Gibbs sampler methods
- remove deprecated methods (stan, BUGSspline, gamboost)
- (long term) remove all methods other than the Gibbs samplers
