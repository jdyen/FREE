# Function Regression in Ecology and Evolution (FREE)

This is a to-do list for the R package FREE (Function Regression in Ecology and Evolution).

Maintainer: Jian Yen

### Tasks to complete:
- develop a method for re-using function calls to run cross validation from a fitted FREEfit model
- add some sort of time estimation for long models (e.g., a status bar)
- update all docs and website info and make a vignette so that the old methods are gone
- return 95% credible intervals for all parameters and use these rather than SDs for plots. Could add these as a list for each parameter, rather than param.mean, param.sd
